# SQL Developer Internship - Task 3

## Objective
This task focuses on writing basic SQL queries to:
- Retrieve data
- Filter rows using WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, BETWEEN
- Sort data using ORDER BY
- Limit output using LIMIT
- Use DISTINCT and Aliases

---

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench

---

## SQL Concepts Covered
- `SELECT *` retrieves all columns from a table.
- `WHERE` filters rows based on a condition.
- `LIKE '%value%'` matches patterns within text.
- `BETWEEN` filters data within a range.
- `IN` matches any value within a provided list.
- `ORDER BY` sorts the results.
- `LIMIT` restricts the number of output rows.
- `AS` is used for aliasing column names.
- `DISTINCT` removes duplicate records.

---

## Queries Included
- Basic selection from all tables.
- Filtering using `WHERE`, `OR`, `AND`, `LIKE`, and `BETWEEN`.
- Sorting using `ORDER BY` and limiting results using `LIMIT`.
- Filtering with `IN` to find related data.
- Selecting distinct classes using `DISTINCT`.
